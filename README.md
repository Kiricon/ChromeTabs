# Chrome Tabs
A working example of chrome like tabs that with no baggage. 

It makes no sense that you would need two libraries to create one set of Elements. 

This is the most minimal possible implementation I could manage my self. If you can think of any way to make this project perform better without adding dependencies please contribute.
